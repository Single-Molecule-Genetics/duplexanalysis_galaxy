The Hamming distances were calculated by comparing the first halve against all halves and selected the minimum value (HD a).
For the second half of the tag, we compared them against all tags which resulted in the minimum HD of the previous step and selected the maximum value (HD b').
Finally, it was possible to calculate the absolute and relative differences between the HDs (absolute and relative delta HD).
These calculations were repeated, but starting with the second half in the first step to find all possible chimeras in the data (HD b and HD  For simplicity we used the maximum value between the delta values in the end.
When only tags that can form DCS were allowed in the analysis, family sizes for the forward and reverse (ab and ba) will be included in the plots.

All tags were filtered: only those tags where at least one half was identical (HD=0) and therefore, had a relative delta of 1 were kept. These tags are considered as chimeric.
So the Hamming distances of the chimeric tags are shown.
